Unit 4 - OOP Game Show App

This is a basic guessing game in which the user is supposed to find all the letter to a given phrase.

There are no pr√© requirementes for this project since its going to run on plain javascript.

The player has 5 lifes, each missed guess will decrease the amount of lifes of the player resulting on a loss.

The winning condition is to guess all the letters from the phrase.

Bonus: 
- Theres a keyboard detection for inputs outside of the game playing field. Also the looks of the playing field were changed to be more similar to a real keyboard.
- The phrases can contain other notations as (., !, ?), so it may be easier to understand as the letters unfold. The guessing still only computes actual letters.
- A point system was added to encourage the players to have subsequent correct guesses and even get better results even on a loss
